# Country Name Generator

Very simple Python script which take all country names (in french), try to split them by syllables in a dummy way (only split at each vowel) and create a list then generate 10 random names built with 2 syllables from the list.

If you need help to find country name for your stories, role play games...

Enjoy and feel free to improve of course :)
